      <h3>Reading #2 </h3>
      <p>Question 1: What are the differences between site specific artwork and the idea of art interventions?</p>

      <p>Site specific artworks are mainly with the intention of making a work of art that exists in a certain outdoor environment. Mostly dealing with sculptures in most site specific artworks but it can be other forms or art mediums. But for the most part, when someone does make a site specific artform, then there is usually some planning involved when deciding where to set it up, either in an urban setting or in nature. Art intervention is different because it utilizes some form of interaction that takes its setting and uses it as context for what it stands for. Usually when an artwork has an interventional element to it, it generally is meant to put commentary on some political issue rather than to stand out on it’s own.</p>

      <p>Question 2: What are the similarities and differences regarding the art work of Robert Irwin, Walter De Maria, Banksy, and Robert Montgomery? Include your thoughts on how their work might interpret ideas of site specificness and/or interventions.</p>

      <p>Regarding the works of Robert Irwin, Walter de Maria, Robert Montgomery and Banksy, All of these artist have a similar theme which is that they take elements from the natural world and use them to their advantage to create art. However, there are some key differences when it comes to these artists. Robert Montgomery’s works deal with minimalism as well as being in the moment such as his lighting wooden text on fire. Robert Irwin’s work focuses on using light to create an experience with how light affects us. And for Banksy, his work deals in more vandalism, where the artwork is meant for the public that is both subjective and integrated with modern life.</p>

      <p>Question 3: What are the main characteristics that separate something being any kind of art versus what all signs must share to be relevant or meaningful? This means ALL signs, from art signs to traffic signs, to signs even in our home.</p>

      <p>All signs are site specific</p>

      <p>Question 4: What kind of art, have you seen that was made in response to its location, its environment, a specific event or situation. Please elaborate on its description and provide images if possible.</p>

      <p>One artwork that I have seen that was sight specific is some of James Turell’s “Skyspace” where there is an structure that is very elemental on the outside but inside, there is nothing but an all white surface, LED lights on the outer edge and an Oculus in the ceiling. And how Turrell uses light from the sun to see how we perceive light and color and how the sky, the LED lights and our eyes change how we see the color of the sky at certain points in time.</p>
