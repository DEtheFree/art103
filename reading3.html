      <h3>Reading #3</h3>
      <p>Q1. From the podcast, how has our understanding of what dinosaurs really look like evolved? Describe the progression of how we portrayed them and how might this affect our understanding of what Archeology is saying about them.</p>

      <p>Originally, we had first viewed dinosaurs as these massive yet slow animals that seemed to be they walked slowly or clumsy, and that they were all descendants from reptiles. Now we see them as these advanced apex predators that were very strong and deadly, and recently, science has found evidence of feathers being on some dinosaurs.</p>

      <p>Q2. The artist/archaeologist John Conway who is doing interpretations of dinosaurs is obviously taking liberty with what could be the actual truth of how these creatures existed. What other fields of science, creative based disciplines and forms of studies use similar techniques that remind you of this method or process.</p>

      <p>Paleo-anthropology, using evidence of the past to try and decide what disoars what really was like. Art is also one since people are constantly trying to make art that would despise what they would look like, such as skin, size, texture, musculature, and other key features.</p>

      <p>Q3. First, summarize in your own words the characteristics of 'Material Speculation' as described in the second article. Then given this article's examples for possible future products, how can this same technique also be used to create objects that refer to the past?</p>

      <p>Material speculation is when the person pays attention to detail in both material, vision and history or archeological data, to grasp the greater picture. Idea of thinking about the cause and effect of making something. Such as how someone made a camera that worked but couldnâ€™t access unless you broke it, gives a different viewpoint on what the meaning of a camera is.</p>

      <p>Q4. What are the 4 most common kinds of artifacts listed in the readings? As these are broad categories can you list, some more specific ones?, They may be either a part of these categories as a subtopic or maybe not under these classifications at all. List 4 more categories and give examples.</p>

      <p>Historical and cultural, Media, Data and Knowledge are the most common artifacts. Such artifacts can be as simple as something that was commonly used or was viewed. Such as pottery shards,spears, metal coins, simple trash, relics or even something like the Camera Obscura that was mentioned earlier.</p>
