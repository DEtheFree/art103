      <p>For this week, we had to pick something from Thingaverse and then had to print it out to test out how to use a 3D printer </p>

      <h3>Phase 2</h3>
      <p>In this example, we were given a chose to pick a hypothectical senerior in which we can create a world with our own rules tied to it.</p>

        <p>Artifact 1: Contraption that can predict how much rainfall.</p>   

        <p>In a world where people naturally photosynthesize, there would be an increase in water demand in which case main people will have to come up with new ideas on how to obtain more water. Now because the tools needed to collect water isn't new. But how about a type of machine, almost like a personal robotic meteorologist that can tell them how long until the next rain storm, at which point, people can do whatever they want to collect water.</p>

        <p>Artifact 2: Device the can tell levels of CO2 to OS in an area</p> 

        <p>Since people will naturally photosynthesize, location would be ideal since people will now be looking for areas that have high concentrations of CO2 to convert to O2. So people would need some kind of device that would measure the levels of CO2 to O2 in an area. Working like a geiger counter, it would take in the air in the encompassing surroundings and would give out a reading as to how much COs would be in the atmosphere.</p>

        <p>The Last idea was done much later but it does show some sort of stone carving which does seem to show some sort of pictographic story of a type of sun god.</p>

      <h3>Phase 3</h3>
      <p>In a world were people have naturally photosynthesizing skin cells. There would be more attention to the sun as people now deeped more heavily on the Sun. Up to the point where the people now treat the sun as a god. At that point. there would be an artifact that people would use with the help from the sun to tell what time people would need to pray to the sun.</p>
