      <p>Q1. -- What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?

      A system is a series of interacting elements that work together under certain principles or environments. A bad example would be a group of parts working together.

      Q2. -- For the 4 system definitions you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.

      Modularity: a system in which any component can be rearranged and still server its function
      Chaos theory: a system in which a reaction can cause a wide range of outcomes be it little or large
      Decomposability The point in which something that formed into a smaller forms of itself until it can no longer break down.
      Emergence: the way in which a complex pattern is formed but with each version of the pattern is different from the other.
      Chaos theory: the system in which one reaction can have 1 out of an infinitive amount of reactions.


      Q3 -- Give us your definition of what Tessellation means and give an example you encountered, not mentioned in the reading.

      A tessellation is the arrangement of geometric shapes in a way that when combined with other shapes make a repeating pattern without any gaps or overlays, one example being in the school bathrooms with the square or hexagon tiles being placed and arranged by color and/or shape. 

      Q4 -- What is The difference between ideas of Modularity and Tessellation? What are the properties that are in opposition with each other?

      With Modularity, any components in the system can be re-arranges in any where as tessellation is more controlled, each part has a certain role to serve.

      Q5 -- What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic) 

      Something that is Uniform/periodic means that the pattern repeats where by its the opposite for something that is Complex/aperiodic where there are random or irregular patterns that ar introduced.
