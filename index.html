          <h2>2/11/2021, Upgrade</h2>
          <h3>In-class questions</h3>
          <h3>
            1) In terms of upgrading something in your body, I would tend to think of something external, more along the line of body prosthetics. I can’t really think of improving my brain since the brain is a complicated and sensitive organ, we still don’t fully know how our brain trule works. And while I do know that we do have technology that does help people by connecting our brain’s electrical impulses with receivers to help us see or move something, it is still somewhat primitive. So I am willing to be more invested in external upgrades rather than brain implants. 
            2) With the development of having science being placed, implanted or injected into ourselves. I see this as a direction of the human race becoming more and more dependent on technology in order to survive. For the future, I can imagine humans staying the same except with the added bonus of having machines helping us with precise surgery, making stronger antibodies for our immune system or to have robotic limbs for people that are disabled or can’t move without assistance. That factor of all this being the idea that technology will help us live longer, not so much to improve the quality of life, but just to live longer.
            3) In terms of usefulness or reliability, it's a hard question to answer since I don’t really think it’ll make much of a difference if the technology would be visible or hidden. In terms if people would take the technology for granted or use it for their own gain, it would be best for it to be hidden since people could damage something if how it is exposed. But for something like aesthetic purposes, it might be cool for the technology to be visible. To see how all the components work and function in unison. Like if someone were to have a prosthetic arm, I would guess that, it could depend on the person. Like if they want an arm that looks like a real arm, then it would be concealed. But if they want to see all the bear gears and joints, to see how they move, then they would want the technology to be revealed. </h3>

          <h2>2/11/2021, Reading Responce 1</h2>
          <h3>Chaper 1
            In the first chapter, we start to learn about the very basics of what cybernetics are. More specifically, the chapter talked mainly about cyborgs and what they are. Ideally, cyborgs could be simplified as modifications to your body to either improve itself or to adapt to a new or forgein environment. It also talked about the concept of implants and whether or not having an implant would categorize someone or something as a cyborg. The rat with the pump attached to its tail was very odd yet interesting since it does say that it was the first documented case of the rat being a cyborg since the pump is used to supplement one of the rats organs. But in terms of technology, it also tells us how we are constantly being surrounded by technology that we are both oblivious to how often yet we are dependent so heavily on its function that we cannot live without it.
          
          1) Klines and Clines definition of a cyborg is described as “the kind of hybrid artifact-organism system they were envisaging, . . . we propose the term “cyborg.” Cyborg deliberately incorporates exogenous components extending the self-regulating control function of the organism in order to adapt it to new environments”. However, Clark’s idea of a cyborg was more of an internal/external change to the human body that runs past our psychological bond to our body, such as using a microchip or an implant. In other words, to have the ability to control certain parts of your body by using your brain, such as controlling your own metabolism, or manually controlling your own heart rate. 
          
          2)In terms of a biological system, I think our kidneys would be a system that would be self-regulating. I mean this in what they do, they filter out all of the toxins that our body naturally produces and then sends all that waist to our bowles to be flushed out of your systems. Without our kidneys, our bodies will slowly go into renal failure and end up dead. As for non-biological systems, our smartphones are something that is self regulating. Keeping track of our data that we input as well as other features that includes monitoring our heart rate, sleep schedule, our alarms and so on.

          3) Historically speaking, there have many accounts of half human and half animal hybrids throughout Greek and Roman mythology, such as Minotaurs, Centaurs and many animal hybrids. But for modern media, I would say that Superheros could be a type of human hybrids, someone with some superpower that they inherited from their parents or some curse or something, I’m not that involved in superhero fandom so I can really say for sure to be an example. Another kind of human hybrid, would be someone hypothetically that were to evolve until they would become a being of pure energy. 

          Chapter 2 
          For this chapter, it talks mainly about how technology is all around us and how it functions into our everyday lives. It talks about different types of technology such as transparent and opaque technology, and how we utilize the tech that we have so often that we often don’t really recognize it or we don’t even know that it's there. Stuff like our phones, our computers, our clocks, etc; allow for us to access all the world's information right in our hands. And while it has made our way of life easier, we have also as a species are so dependent on it. It's almost hard to imagine a time when we didn’t rely on technology, since we mostly take it for granted. Which also brings into question the realm of virtual reality and digital immersion.
          
          1) Opaque technology refers to the type of technology that requires skill and thought to solve, technology that more than often confuses the user and that must take careful searching to see what problems there are, requires skills that are not required by natural biological means. Whereas transparent technology refers to technology that surrounds us in our day to day lives, stuff that we see so often that we don’t often recognize that they’re there, almost invisible so to say.
         
          2) I would say that while there could be hundreds of examples that could be better if they were more transparent, I would say that street lights would be something. While there are already street lights out already around use, I still feel that having a tall metal pole with a light at the top could be modified so that I could still be functional but less noticeable in terms of what they look like. But for being opaque, I would say that general code is something that both require skill to learn and figure out while still being hidden from the general public.

          3)Personally, I’m a bit conflicted as to if the example is valid or not. One the one hand, people with access to the internet can easily look up anything such as a definition, the time, recordings and other pockets of information. But at the same time, there are still people that either don’t have or don't use the internet, and are still dependent on older means of getting information, such as a dictionary or a watch. But people still use dictionaries and watch despite having access to the web. It's more the fact that the means of retrieving information is constantly changing. So I can’t really say if the example is valid or not.</h3>

          <h2> Reading Responce 2, 3/23/21</h2>
          <h3>Chapter 3 
          For this chapter, we discussed the topic of how our body works when it comes to using a tool. What I mean by that is our bodies will sometimes trick our minds into thinking when we use some sort of tool like a stick or a wrench, we often think about that tool as an extension of our body, instead of an external tool. Which also brings into the topic of how technology affects us, and how our brains are able to retain information, like language. How we perceive technology, it can be seen somewhat as an extension of your human body, able to gather information and put it right at our fingertips. As well as learning, its a natural process of gathering information and storing it in our mind because i could help us out later in our lives.
 
          1) As it says in the book, the way that your senses work is by having our body be in control of something and a series of nerves send electrical signals to our brain which interpret certain types of actions, movements or senses. Such as how we can feel our nose when we touch it due to the fact that our nerves sense our hand making contact with your nose, and how our brains can recognise that your hand is touching our nose by the sensations we feel in our hands. As well as a process of recollections like understanding that we can see your own hand touching our own body and memorizing that we move our hand for the purpose of touching our nose. However, like the book explained, sometime our brains can often mistake an external item or tool, to be integrated with our own body. For example, I wear glasses because I can’t see things far away without them, so I use them to see things clearly. But sometimes there have been moments where I had thought I had misplaced my glasses, so I spend several minutes looking for them until I come to the realization that I had been wearing them the entire time. That is because I have become so used to wearing them I tend to forget that I’m wearing them and that I’m seeing the world with my own eyes. That is one example of how our brains have misled me into believing that my glasses were integrated with my body.
 
          2) To our relationship with language, in the “Early Adopters Dream Technology” example. It suggests that when it comes to new technology, that we often rely heavily on our language stills to determine and categorize the things that we know, are aware of or can see. But what if there comes a time where a piece of technology has become so advanced that we can access all of the world’s questions and answers right at your fingertips? Which brings the question of if we rely on a piece of technology to do most of our work for us, then would that render our own mental functions obsolete? To become more dependent on your brains instead of your bodies. In the same sense, the Mangrove analogy states that trees normally need land in order for its seed to sprout and grow. But for the mangrove tree, its seed floats on top of the water and sprouts vertical roots down until it finds soft mud. At which point, as the tree grows, the root starts to collect any building materials that float by in the water until it eventually builds land for which to stand on. How it relates to language is by how our language skills the roots and how to grow but collecting the debris of new ideas that we experience which leads us to build our own. I personally agree with both analogies because I do often wonder if this advancement of technology is really beneficial to use since now, we don’t really need to use our brains that much since we can access the world information with our laptops. And as to the Mangrove analogy, I do agree that it's a good comparison to how we develop our language skills since we learn by what we experience. Intaking new information for us to build off of.
 
          3) The idea of Meta learning is about acquiring and exploiting information rather than knowing the basic function of how the world works, So learning how something works by looking at it. Whereas constructive learning is on one's own basics understanding of something can either be altered or expanded as we learn, meaning that we can learn a certain fixed number of things or we can learn but slowly build up what we learn over time. What these two ideas have in common is that they both revolve around a method or learning and how we can retain information. As we perceive the lesson that we are learning, our brains use certain methods for us to hold that information that we’ve learned and how we can use the information to either build upon it, or have it relate to another lesson that we've learned. Although all of this is very interesting to think about. I don't really think I can learn much from this, since I wouldn’t really know what to do with this information. Its neat to think about how your brains retain lessons learned but I don’t spend my time thinking about how my brain works and how I could improve upon it. I would say that this would only be useful to categorize people by the methods that find easiest to learn from.
 
          Chapter 4
          In this chapter, it talked about the concept of telepresence, which is the idea of using our own bodily applications such as sights and our ability to move our body to apply some sort of action. But to use those skills and apply it to technology that we can control but at a distance. Such as using a robot to do work in an environment that would be tough for regular humans to do but is still being controlled through human actions. And this comes into a question of how it can affect our livelihood, how could this be applied to daily life, and what could this bring for the human race. And is all of this technology really beneficial? Or could it be harmful to our existence. 
 
          1) As far As I could gather, the two components that are required for telepresence to function are both visual feedback and action inputs. Meaning that in order for it to work is to have inputs that allow us to see what we are looking at and have input that allow us to make some sort of action happen in the outside world, in short making something move. We understand this because for telepressents, its normally used for us humans to control or do a certain action on an environment that wouldn’t normally be hospitable for any human to be in, such as the act of dealing with industrial waste or in a place with extreme temperature. Why uor visual input and action output is because we already use that for our biological bodies, have eyes to just to see out of, but to act upon the environment that we are in to manipulate it for our own benefit.
 
          2) The only time that I would say that I have experienced a form of telepresence was during the time that I was flying a drone. My friend had let me borrow his remote controlled drone and was able to make it fly and do certain actions on his phone.  Would say that it was a form of telepresence since I was looking at the drone’s perspective through its built-in camera and I was manipulating its controls and action, which besides flying around was able to use its blinking lights and landing gears. Even though I was able to look at the drones POV and was able to move it around, I wouldn’t say that it was true telepresence since there were limited options that I could do. Aside from that, I have experienced much telepresence but I do experience telecommunication on a daily basis. Now that Zoom has become the place to go to have my classes on. I can see and communicate to my teacher without having to leave my room. But if there was some sort of machine that was somewhere else but I could still see and could control its movement by typing a command or pressing a key, then I guess that could be considered as telepresence. 
 
          3) So from what I understand of telepresence is that it requires that the user must be away from the machine or “slave” but still have the ability to control its actions and or movement based on my visual input and physical actions. But for other types of mechanics or modalities, it could be possible for them to have some sort of telepresence built into them. The only thing that I can think of that would have these applications would be for security purposes. Such as how security can monitor the visual inputs that the security cameras can capture, and see anything suspicious happening then they can do some action that could sound an alarm or lock all the exits. But I guess its not really the same since both mechanics are separate. Meaning that a security guard can look through the security camera but can do much action to influence the camera to do any other options, except perhaps making it move by controlling where its pointing at. Now if say the camera had a special type of utility hooked into it, such as a gas emitter, laser pointer or even have a gun attached to it, then I would say then it would be a type of machine that would be reliant on telepresence. Aside from military drones, and satellites, and possibly human controlled robots and other technology, there are now plenty of devices now that can now be used as a form of telepresence. And it has become widely available to the public now what pretty much, most of man's work will still be done by man, but with the assistance of machines doing all of the heavy labor for us.</h3>

        <h3>Artist Statement and log</h3>
        <h4>I guess the goal of this particular project was to try and design out something that would resemble those diagrams how how the wheels of a steam locomotive would move. I have always been facinated by the working components of steam trains, esspecally the wheels and I wanted to make something that would resemble it. Orignally I had wanted my design to be bigger so that a person would have to stand and strech their arms out so their arms would activate the sensors and that would in tunr, activate the machine.
        One of the main problems that I had had was the software since I was using three motors, I would have to use a capasitor to limit the amount of energy needed to power the motors so that they wouldn't burn out. A few other problem had occured when during soildering up my power supply, the wires got conflicked and would overheat and burn the wires. I managed to correct the issue which lead my to my biggest challenge which was to figure out the sofeware.</h4>
