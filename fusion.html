      <p>During the making of this project, it was kinda difficult getting used to Fusion 360 since it had been a while since I had last used a 3D modeling program but once I was able to review the class recording and see what everyone else was doing. I was able to get the hang of how to make a 3D model.</p>

        <p>For the the second teapot, I didn't make a sketch of it before hand. I had just made it all in Fusion by just developing it as I thought about what addition would make the mode look cool.</p>
